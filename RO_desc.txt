Daily Immersion Action:
Doing any one of the following actions grants a bonus to Immersion until the player sleeps.

Damaged Weapons and Armor:
Weapons and armor can become damaged and be repaired at a forge.  Only basic and crafted weapons and armor can be damaged.  A weapon may be damaged when striking or parrying an attack. Taking a hit can damage armor.  The player's Immersion and Stamina affect the likelyhood that equipment will be damaged.
